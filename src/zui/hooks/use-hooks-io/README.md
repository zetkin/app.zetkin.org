# useHooks.io

The hooks in this directory are downloaded from useHooks.io and can be managed by
using the `npx usehooks-cli@latest` CLI tool.
Do not edit these files directly (prettier and eslint will ignore them as well), but use either the `update` command or
create
a PR on the source repository at https://github.com/small-lab-io/usehooks.io.
