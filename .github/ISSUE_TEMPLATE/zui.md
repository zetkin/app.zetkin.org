## Open questions

## Possible implementations

Develop this using Storybook. We want all the design system components to be documented through their own Storybook stories.

For reference, you can look at the already existing ZUI components created on the `undocumented/new-design-system` branch (not ZUI components that exist on `main`, as they are not part of the new design system.)

## Git

The main git branch for the work on the new design system is `undocumented/new-design-system`. Unless otherwise instructed, do your work on a new branch branched off from this branch.

Name your branch `issue-number/zui-name`, ex: `issue-928/zui-button` for a branch where work is done that is documented in the issue with number 928, where a button component is being made.
